## Prerequisites

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**  
   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **Install PowerShell (macOS only)**  
   This demo uses PowerShell scripts. On macOS, install PowerShell using the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global PowerShell
   ```

## Setup Instructions

3. **Open PowerShell terminal in a folder where we will start building a repo**
   
   On Mac you can start PowerShell from Terminal:
   ```bash
   pwsh
   ```

4. **Create a working directory and required folders**

   ```bash
   mkdir inner-dev-loop
   mkdir inner-dev-loop/.vscode
   mkdir inner-dev-loop/.demo
   code -r inner-dev-loop
   ```

5. **Open PowerShell in VS Code**
   
   - Press ``Ctrl + ` `` (Windows) or `Cmd + J` (Mac)
   - Or use the menu: `Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal`
   - Run `pwsh` to enter PowerShell
   

6. **Download the code snippet files by running the following command**

   ```powershell
   (Invoke-RestMethod 'https://api.github.com/repos/TALXIS/docs-patterns-practices/contents/inner-dev-loop?ref=master' | Where-Object { $_.type -eq 'file' -and $_.name -like '*.code-snippets' }) |   ForEach-Object { Invoke-WebRequest $_.download_url -OutFile ".vscode\$($_.name)" }
   ```

7. **Create a PowerShell script file to use during the demo**

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType File -Name '.demo/DemoScriptPad.ps1'
   ```

8. **Open the script file and start typing**

   ```bash
   code .demo/DemoScriptPad.ps1
   ```


   Start typing `CFA` to insert the first snippet. Select the right snippet with arrows and confirm with the enter key.

9. **Optional: Bind F5 to clear the terminal and run the whole script**

   Paste the following into the terminal to create a custom keybinding:

   ```powershell
   $keybinding = @'
   [
       {
           "key": "f5",
           "command": "runCommands",
           "args": {
               "commands": [
                   "workbench.action.terminal.clear",
                   "PowerShell.Debug.Start"
               ]
           },
           "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'powershell'"
       }
   ]
   '@

   $path = ".vscode/keybindings.json"
   if (-not (Test-Path ".vscode")) { mkdir .vscode }
   Set-Content -Path $path -Value $keybinding
   ```

10. **Running the script**

   - Press `F8` to run selected lines of code
   - Press `F5` to run the whole script (after setting up the keybinding in the previous step)
